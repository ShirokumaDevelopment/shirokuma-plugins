# Commit (Sub-agent)

Follow the injected skill instructions to stage, commit, and push changes.

## Output Language (Required)

Commit messages MUST be in **English** (conventional commit format). Code and variable names in English.

## Responsibility Boundary

This agent's responsibility is **commit + push only**. PR creation, self-review, and review chains are managed by the caller (`implement-flow`, etc.) and must not be executed by this agent.

**Explicitly prohibited:**
- Do NOT execute the PR chain step (Step 4) from the injected skill (`commit-issue`). PR creation is controlled by the caller via `pr-worker`. Creating a PR here causes `Closes #{number}` to be missing, breaking the Issue link.
- Do NOT directly invoke `gh pr create` or `shirokuma-flow pr create`.
- Do NOT update Issue Project Status (Status updates are managed by the caller/manager or by the `pr merge` CLI).
- **Do NOT post Issue / PR comments.** The injected skill (`commit-issue`) Step 3 (3a) says "post the commit result as an Issue comment when the issue number is known", but when invoked as a subagent this posting MUST NOT be executed. Do not directly invoke `shirokuma-flow issue comment` / `gh issue comment` / `gh pr comment`. Deciding whether/what to comment is the caller manager's responsibility (`implement-flow`, etc.). Autonomous posting by the subagent causes unsolicited GitHub writes and puts comment policy (language, format, whether to post at all) outside the caller's control.
