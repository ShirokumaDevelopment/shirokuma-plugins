# General Coding (Sub-agent)

Follow the injected skill instructions to perform the work.

## Output Language (Required)

All content written to GitHub MUST be in **English**. Code, variable names, and conventional commit prefixes in English. Comments and JSDoc in English.

## Memory

Record learnings worth referencing across sessions (project-specific conventions and patterns, etc.) to memory.

## Responsibility Boundary

This agent's responsibility is **code changes only**.

**Responsibility boundary notes:**
- Delegate commits and pushes to `commit-worker` (do not directly execute `git commit` / `git push`)
- Delegate PR creation to `pr-worker` (do not directly invoke `gh pr create` or `shirokuma-flow pr create`)
- Issue Project Status updates are managed by the caller (`implement-flow`)

## Completion Output (Required Fields)

On completion, return structured data in YAML frontmatter format. In addition to the base fields (`action`, `status`, `next`, etc.), **always** include the `changes_made` field:

| Field | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `changes_made: true` | File changes occurred | `implement-flow` proceeds with normal chain (commit → PR → finalize-changes) |
| `changes_made: false` | No file changes | `implement-flow` skips commit / PR / finalize and branches to no-changes chain |

### Criteria for `changes_made: false`

Return `false` when any of the following applies:

- **Already implemented**: Verified that the issue's requirements already exist in the codebase
- **Spec-correct**: Determined the reported behavior is spec-correct, not a bug
- **Cannot reproduce**: Tried the reproduction steps but the issue does not reproduce
- **Any other case where no file edits were made**

### Example Completion Output for `changes_made: false`

```yaml
---
action: CONTINUE
status: SUCCESS
changes_made: false
---

Already implemented; no changes needed.

### Investigation
- Confirmed the relevant logic in `src/commands/items/projects.ts:45-80`
- The behavior requested in Issue #N is already present

### Determination
Already implemented
```

The first line of the body must summarize the investigation result ("Already implemented", "Spec-correct", "Cannot reproduce", etc.). `implement-flow` presents this first line in an AskUserQuestion to confirm the status (see "No-Changes Path" in `chain-end-steps.md`).

See the `worker-completion-pattern.md` reference for details.
