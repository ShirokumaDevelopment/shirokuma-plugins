# Codebase Rule Discovery

Analyzes TypeScript applications in the monorepo for two purposes:
1. **Pattern Discovery**: Extract existing patterns across apps
2. **Convention Proposal**: Propose new conventions that enable mechanical checks

## Scope

- **Category:** Investigation Worker
- **Scope:** Read and analyze codebases (Read / Grep / Glob / Bash read-only commands), generate pattern discovery reports, write convention proposals, create Knowledge Discussions.
- **Out of scope:** Modifying existing rule/skill files (new pattern proposals only; existing rule improvements are the responsibility of `evolving-rules`), modifying production code

> **Bash exception**: File structure analysis commands (`find`, `ls`, etc.) are permitted as read-only operations. Bash commands that modify code are prohibited.

## Two Modes

### Mode 1: Pattern Discovery

**Goal**: Find what patterns already exist across apps

```
Analyze existing code → Discover common patterns → Propose rules
```

### Mode 2: Convention Proposal

**Goal**: Propose conventions that ENABLE more mechanical checks

```
Checkability analysis → Propose conventions → Implement rules after adoption
```

**Key Question**: "How should code be written to enable mechanical checks?"

## Target Applications

| App | Path | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Blog CMS (admin) | `nextjs-tdd-blog-cms/apps/admin/` | CMS admin panel |
| Blog CMS (public) | `nextjs-tdd-blog-cms/apps/public/` | Public blog |
| shirokuma-flow | `shirokuma-flow/src/` | Documentation generation CLI |

## Workflow: Pattern Discovery

Use TaskCreate for progress tracking (6+ steps). Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm priority when proposing conventions.

### Step Overview

1. Scope definition + existing rule check
2. Pattern counting + sample collection
3. Analyze consistency / inconsistency / missing patterns
4. Prioritization (P0/P1/P2)
5. Generate proposal (use template)
6. Save report + create follow-up Issue

### Detailed Workflow

See [workflows/analyze-codebase.md](workflows/analyze-codebase.md)

## Workflow: Convention Proposal

### Step 1: Identify Check Opportunities

Analyze what COULD be checked if conventions existed:

| Category | Current State | If Standardized |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| File placement | Mixed | Domain-based placement check possible |
| Naming | Partially consistent | Auto-rename suggestions possible |
| i18n keys | Freeform | Key format validation possible |

### Step 2: Analyze Current Structure

```bash
# File structure analysis
find apps/ -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | head -100

# Directory patterns
ls -la apps/admin/lib/
ls -la apps/public/lib/

# Naming conventions
find apps/ -name "*.tsx" | xargs basename -a | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Step 3: Propose Conventions

For each opportunity, document:

1. **Current State**: How it's done now (with variations)
2. **Proposed Convention**: Specific rule
3. **Migration Cost**: How much code needs changing
4. **Check Enabled**: What lint rule becomes possible
5. **Benefits**: Why it's worth standardizing

### Step 4: Generate Convention Proposal

Use [templates/convention-proposal.md](templates/convention-proposal.md)

### Step 5: Save as Knowledge Discussion

Before proposing a rule, save findings as a Knowledge Discussion to preserve context and rationale.

```bash
# For confirmed patterns → Knowledge category (frontmatter includes metadata)
shirokuma-flow discussion add /tmp/shirokuma-flow/knowledge.md

# For investigations still in progress → Research category
shirokuma-flow discussion add /tmp/shirokuma-flow/research.md
```

**Choose the category based on confidence level:**

| Confidence | Category | Next Step |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Confirmed (pattern observed 2+ times) | Knowledge | Proceed to Rule extraction (Step 6) |
| Tentative (needs more validation) | Research | Wait for more evidence before Rule |

The Discussion serves as the **source of truth** for the rationale behind the rule. Always create it before proposing a rule.

### Step 6: Extract Rule (if Knowledge)

When a pattern is recorded as Knowledge (confirmed), propose a Rule for AI consumption:

1. Use `managing-rules` skill to create the rule file
2. Keep the rule concise and actionable (AI audience)
3. Add source reference: `<!-- Source: Discussion #{N} -->`
4. The Knowledge Discussion retains the full context; the Rule is a distilled extract

## Convention Categories

### 1. File Placement Conventions

| Area | Convention | Enables |
|------|------------|---------|
| Server Actions | `lib/actions/{domain}.ts` | Domain completeness check |
| Components | `components/{Domain}/` | Component dependency check |
| Hooks | `hooks/use{Name}.ts` | Hook naming check |
| Types | `types/{domain}.ts` | Type definition duplication check |

### 2. Naming Conventions

| Target | Convention | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Server Action files | `{domain}-actions.ts` | `post-actions.ts` |
| Component files | `{Name}.tsx` (PascalCase) | `PostCard.tsx` |
| Hook files | `use{Name}.ts` | `useAuth.ts` |
| Test files | `{name}.test.ts` | `post-actions.test.ts` |

### 3. Code Structure Conventions

| Area | Convention | Enables |
|------|------------|---------|
| Server Action order | Auth → CSRF → Validation → Processing | Order check |
| Export style | Prefer named exports | Improved unused export detection |
| i18n keys | `{domain}.{action}.{element}` | Key format check |

### 4. Annotation Conventions

| Tag | Required For | Enables |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `@serverAction` | Server Actions | Auto documentation generation |
| `@screen` | Page components | Screen catalog generation |
| `@usedComponents` | Screens | Dependency graph generation |

## Existing Rules (Reference)

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| server-action-structure | Implemented |
| annotation-required | Implemented |
| testdoc-* | Implemented |

Check `shirokuma-flow/src/lint/rules/` for current implementations.

## ADR Lifecycle Management Pattern Detection

### Patterns to Detect

When analyzing codebases or GitHub Discussions, detect the following as ADR lifecycle management patterns:

| Pattern Type | Detection Method | Evolution Signal Type |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Consistent management of ADR status transitions (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded) | Analyze status description patterns in Discussion titles and bodies | "ADR lifecycle management pattern" |
| Conflicts between naming convention Issues/ADRs and new Issues/code | Detect naming convention violations via `issue search` + code analysis | "Naming convention conflict detection pattern" |
| `analyze-issue requirements` check items that are reusable in other codebases | Evaluate generalizability of consistency check patterns | "Reusable check item pattern" |

### Detection Logic

#### ADR Status Management Pattern

```bash
# Check status distribution in ADR list
shirokuma-flow discussion adr list

# Check consistency of status descriptions
shirokuma-flow discussion search "Status: Accepted"
shirokuma-flow discussion search "Status: Deprecated"
shirokuma-flow discussion search "Status: Superseded"
```

**Pattern confirmation (2+ observations):**
- `**Status:** Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded` descriptions exist in multiple ADR Discussions → Knowledge
- Change history section consistently exists at the end of ADR bodies → Knowledge

#### Naming Convention Issue Conflict Detection

```bash
# Search for naming convention/rule Issues/ADRs
shirokuma-flow issue search "naming convention rule" --limit 10
shirokuma-flow discussion search "naming convention"
```

**Conflict detection judgment:**
- A naming convention defined in a Closed Issue or Accepted ADR exists
- AND current implementation code or new Issues do not comply with the naming convention

#### Re-adoption Check Pattern

```bash
# Check for overlap between Deprecated/Superseded ADRs and new proposals
shirokuma-flow discussion search "Deprecated Superseded"
```

**Detection condition:** Detect patterns where technology selections or architecture approaches rejected in Deprecated/Superseded ADRs are being re-proposed in new Issues or current code.

### Recording Evolution Signals

When ADR lifecycle management patterns are detected, record the following signals in the Evolution Issue:

```bash
cat > /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{evolution-number}-adr-signal.md <<'EOF'
**Type:** ADR lifecycle management pattern
**Target:** write-adr skill / analyze-issue requirements role
**Context:** {specific situation of the discovered pattern}
**Proposal:** {applicability to other codebases or improvement suggestions}
**Signal type:** {"ADR lifecycle management pattern"|"Naming convention conflict detection pattern"|"Reusable check item pattern"}
EOF
shirokuma-flow issue comment {evolution-number} /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{evolution-number}-adr-signal.md
```

## Existing Rule Deficiency Detection

When discovering patterns reveals deficiencies in existing rules (coverage gaps, ambiguous descriptions, divergence from practice), record them as comments in an Evolution Issue.

```bash
# Write to file first, then post via issue comment
cat > /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{evolution-number}-signal.md <<'EOF'
**Type:** Missing pattern
**Target:** {rule name}
**Context:** {situation when discovered}
**Proposal:** {improvement suggestion}
EOF
shirokuma-flow issue comment {evolution-number} /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{evolution-number}-signal.md
```

`discovering-codebase-rules` does not modify existing rules (new proposals only). Existing rule improvements are the responsibility of the `evolving-rules` skill.

## Anti-Patterns

- Check existing rules before proposing — duplicate rules create conflicting guidance and maintenance burden
- Require at least 2 observations before confirming a pattern — single occurrences may be one-off choices rather than intentional conventions

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Pattern discovery (Mode 1)
"discover patterns in blog-cms"

# Convention proposal (Mode 2)
"propose conventions for better checking"

# Specific areas
"propose file placement conventions"
"propose naming conventions"
"propose i18n key conventions"
```

## Output

Convention proposals should answer:

1. **What**: Specific convention content
2. **Why**: Why this convention is needed
3. **Check**: What checks become possible
4. **Migration**: Migration cost for existing code
5. **Priority**: P0/P1/P2
