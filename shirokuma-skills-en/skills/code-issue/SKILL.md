## Project Rules

!`shirokuma-flow rules inject --scope coding-worker`

# Generic Coding

Generic coding skill delegated from `implement-flow`. Routes to framework-specific skills (discovered via `skills routing coding`) via Skill delegation or performs direct editing based on work type.

## Context

The following context is passed as arguments from `implement-flow`:

- Issue number
- Plan section (work content)
- Labels (`area:*` etc.)
- Work type classification result

No need to re-fetch the issue.

## Skill Discovery (Run Before Dispatch)

In addition to fixed dispatch table entries, dynamically detect project-specific skills:

```bash
shirokuma-flow skills routing coding
```

Refer to the `description` of each entry in the output `routes` array and route to the skill that best matches the issue requirements.
Entries with `source: "discovered"` / `source: "config"` are project-specific skills.
If a fixed table skill is optimal, it takes precedence regardless of discovery results.

## Dispatch

| Work Type | Condition | Route |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Framework-specific implementation | `area:frontend`, `area:cli` + framework related | Skill delegate to discovered `coding-*` skill |
| Bug fix (code) | Affects code files | Skill delegate to discovered `coding-*` skill or direct edit |
| Markdown / documentation editing | `.md` file changes | Direct edit |
| Skill / rule / agent editing | Under `plugin/`, `.claude/` | Skill delegate to discovered `coding-claude-config` skill |
| Refactoring | `refactor` keyword | Direct edit |
| Config / Chore | `config`, `chore` keywords | Direct edit |

## Local Documentation Reference

When `implement-flow` passes documentation sources with `status: "ready"`, use them during implementation:

```bash
# Search with implementation-related keywords (retrieve full sections)
shirokuma-flow docs search "<keyword>" --source <source-name> --section --limit 5
```

Use the provided documentation sources to implement in accordance with official documentation. If no sources are provided, skip this step (use conventional approaches such as WebSearch).

## Work Type Guidance

### Framework-Specific Implementation / Bug Fix

Skill delegate to the discovered `coding-*` skill that matches the project's framework. Pass plan section and issue context.

### Markdown / Documentation Editing

- Follow existing documentation structure and style
- Comply with `output-language` rule
- Verify link integrity

### Skill / Rule / Agent Editing

**Delegate to `coding-claude-config` via Skill tool.** Direct editing is prohibited (bypasses EN/JA sync and quality review).
- Files under `plugin/` — note `plugin-version-bump` rule (version bumps at release time only)

### Refactoring

- Focus on structural improvement without changing behavior
- If tests exist, run them to confirm no regressions

### Config / Chore

- Follow config file schema and format
- Verify impact scope for dependency changes

## Constraints

- Runs via Skill tool (main context), but progress management is handled by the manager (`implement-flow`)
- TDD workflow is managed by `implement-flow` wrapping `code-issue` calls with TDD steps (`code-issue` focuses solely on implementation)
- UI design tasks (new UI pages, visual redesigns, design system token changes) are handled by `design-flow` → discovered design skills, not by this skill
- **Commit, push, and PR creation are outside the scope of this skill**. This skill is responsible for code changes only — `commit-issue` handles commits and `open-pr-issue` handles PR creation in the subsequent chain. Do not directly execute `git commit` / `git push` / `gh pr create` / `shirokuma-flow pr create`
