# Preparing on Issue (Orchestrator)

> **Chain Autonomous Progression**: After the plan review skill (review step) completes, immediately proceed to status update and user return. Stopping after the review skill forces the user to manually prompt continuation, breaking the planning workflow. Use the `**Review result:**` string to determine the review outcome and act without waiting for user input.

Orchestrate the planning phase for an issue: fetch the issue, manage status transitions, delegate plan creation to `plan-issue` (via Agent tool / `plan-worker`), conduct plan review, and return control to the user with a Review approval gate. **Does not proceed to implementation.**

## Task Registration (Required)

Register all chain steps via TaskCreate **before starting work**.

| # | content | activeForm | Skill |
|---|---------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Fetch issue and update status | Fetching issue and updating status | Manager direct: `shirokuma-flow issue context` + `shirokuma-flow begin` |
| 2 | [Conditional] Conduct research | Conducting research | `researching-best-practices` (subagent: `research-worker`) |
| 3 | Create the plan | Creating the plan | `plan-issue` (subagent: `plan-worker`) |
| 4 | Review the plan | Reviewing the plan | `analyze-issue` (subagent: `review-worker`) |
| 5 | [Conditional] Fix review issues and re-review | Fixing review issues and re-reviewing | `plan-issue` (subagent: `plan-worker`) + `analyze-issue` (subagent: `review-worker`) |
| 4a | [Conditional] Create sub-issues for epic plan | Creating sub-issues | Manager direct: `shirokuma-flow issue add/parent/update` |
| 6 | Update status and return plan summary to user | Updating status and returning plan summary to user | Manager direct: `shirokuma-flow submit` |

Dependencies: step 2 blockedBy 1 (conditional: only when research trigger applies), step 3 blockedBy 1 or 2, step 4 blockedBy 3, step 5 blockedBy 4 (conditional: only on NEEDS_REVISION), step 4a blockedBy 4 or 5 (conditional: only for epic plans), step 6 blockedBy 4 or 5 or 4a.

Update each step to `in_progress` at start and `completed` on finish via TaskUpdate. Step 2 is skipped when no trigger applies. Task 5 (revision loop) is skipped on PASS (may be omitted from the task list).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch Issue

```bash
shirokuma-flow issue context {number}
# → Read .shirokuma/github/{org}/{repo}/issues/{number}/body.md
```

Review title, body, type, priority, size, labels, and comments.

### Step 1b: Set Status to In Progress + Assign

Branch by current Issue status. Assignee is idempotent, so always execute.

| Current Status | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| ToDo | Transition to In progress to record the planning start |
| In progress | Skip (continuing planning) |
| Review | **Confirm re-planning via AskUserQuestion** → if "Yes", transition back to In progress (explicit confirmation prevents overwriting a completed plan-review state) |

```bash
# When ToDo, or Review with re-plan confirmed: status In progress + self-assign in one command
shirokuma-flow begin {number}
```

> `begin` is a checkpoint command that runs `status transition --to "In progress"` and `issue assign @me` in sequence. Equivalent primitive form: `shirokuma-flow status transition {number} --to "In progress"` + `shirokuma-flow issue assign {number} "@me"`.

> **Re-planning from Review**: Review is the explicit signal "plan review complete, awaiting implementation approval"; re-planning requires deliberate user intent. Use `AskUserQuestion` with "Issue is in Review (awaiting implementation approval). Start re-planning?", and only revert to In Progress if the user answers "Yes". On "No", cancel the planning step and return control to the caller.

### Step 2: Research Trigger Assessment (Conditional)

Assess the need for research from the issue title, body, labels, and type using the following heuristics.

#### Research Trigger Conditions (research runs if any one condition is met)

| Condition Category | Assessment Criteria |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| New / unknown library | Issue mentions an external library or technology with no existing usage in the codebase |
| Architecture change | Keywords: `architecture`, `redesign`, `rearchitecture`, `architectural change` |
| Security-related | Keywords: `auth`, `authorization`, `security`, `vulnerability`, `authentication` |
| Performance optimization | Keywords: `performance`, `optimization`, `bottleneck` |
| External API integration | Keywords: `API integration`, `webhook`, `external service`, `external API` |
| Explicit best-practice request | Issue body contains requests like "research best practices", "how should I implement" |

#### Post-Assessment Action

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| No trigger | Proceed to Step 2b (pre-delegation check, research skipped) |
| Trigger applies | Proceed to Step 2a (conduct research) |

> **Reducing false positives**: The keyword list is intentionally conservative. Simple feature additions, bug fixes, and documentation edits normally do not trigger research. When in doubt, default to skipping.

### Step 2a: Conduct Research (Conditional)

When a research trigger applies, delegate to `researching-best-practices` via `research-worker`.

```text
Agent(
  description: "research-worker #{number}",
  subagent_type: "research-worker",
  prompt: "Conduct research needed to plan #{number}. Issue: {title}. Topics to investigate: {specific topics matching the trigger}."
)
```

After research completes, include the findings (recommended patterns, constraints, alternatives) in the `plan-issue` delegation prompt in Step 3.

Pass research results to the `plan-issue` prompt using this format:

```
Create a plan for #{number}.

## Research Findings (Reference)
{research-worker output: official recommendations, project patterns, recommendations summary}
```

If research-worker errors, log a warning, skip research, and proceed to Step 3 (plan creation without research).

### Step 2b: Pre-delegation Checks

#### Existing Plan Check

Check `subIssuesSummary` to see whether a child issue with a title starting with "Plan:" exists.

| Plan state | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No plan issue | Proceed to Step 3 (delegate to plan-issue) |
| Plan issue exists | Ask whether to overwrite (AskUserQuestion) before proceeding |

#### Sub-issue reset path when non-plan sub-issues exist

When child issues with titles that do NOT start with "Plan:" exist (count > 0), ask the user before re-planning (AskUserQuestion):

- **Continue (re-plan keeping existing sub-issues)**: Update the plan document only; keep existing sub-issues.
- **Reset (cancel all sub-issues and re-plan)**: Execute the following:
  1. Cancel all non-plan sub-issues via `shirokuma-flow issue cancel {sub-numbers}` to set them to **Done(NOT_PLANNED)** (internally recorded as `state_reason: not_planned` close + Status: Done, #2204; `issue cancel` automatically detaches the cancelled issue from its own parent, #2252, and also unparents any grandchild issues, #2024 Phase 2-A)
  2. Force the parent back to ToDo: `shirokuma-flow status transition {parent-number} --to "ToDo" --force` (ToDo transitions are NOT supported by checkpoint commands `begin`/`submit`/`block`/`resume`/`approve`/`reject`/`cancel`, so the primitive is used directly. The auto-sync in `integrity --fix` does not distinguish `state_reason: not_planned` and would transition the parent to Done instead, so `--force` manual reset is the canonical path)
  3. Return to Step 1b to re-transition to In progress, then proceed to Step 3 (plan-issue delegation)

  > **Alternative**: When sub-issues themselves have linked PRs or grandchild issues, use `shirokuma-flow issue rollback {sub-number} --action cancel` per sub-issue instead — it batch-executes related PR closure, branch deletion, grandchild unparenting, and Done(NOT_PLANNED) marking. Replace step 1 with rollback, then proceed to step 2 (force parent back to ToDo).

### Step 3: Delegate to plan-worker

Invoke `plan-worker` via Agent tool to delegate plan creation to the `plan-issue` skill.

```text
Agent(
  description: "plan-worker plan #{number}",
  subagent_type: "plan-worker",
  prompt: "Create a plan for #{number}."
)
```

The plan-issue skill performs codebase investigation, creates the plan, creates a plan issue, posts a thinking process comment, and sets up the parent-child relationship.

#### Post-Completion Handling

If plan-worker completes successfully, proceed to Step 4 (plan review). If an error occurs, stop and report to the user.

### Step 3 delegation prompt note

When research was conducted (Step 2a), include the `## Research Findings (Reference)` section in the delegation prompt. When research was skipped, use the standard prompt (`Create a plan for #{number}.`).

### Step 4: Plan Review (Skill Delegation)

Reviewing in the same context that wrote the plan cannot catch blind spots. Delegate review to `analyze-issue` plan role via Agent tool (`review-worker`). Since the plan-issue skill creates a plan issue (child issue), the reviewer can identify the child issue with a title starting with "Plan:" from `subIssuesSummary` and fetch its body directly via `issue context {plan-issue-number}`.

#### Skill Availability Check (Fallback)

Before launching the review, verify that `analyze-issue` is available in the skill list.

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Skill available | Proceed to "Invoke the Reviewer" below |
| Skill unavailable | Use "Fallback (self-check)" instead |

**Fallback (self-check)**: When `analyze-issue` is unavailable, verify plan quality using this checklist:
- [ ] Does the plan address all requirements in the Issue?
- [ ] Are there any missing tasks?
- [ ] Is the deliverable (definition of done) clearly defined?
- [ ] Are risks/concerns identified (for complex Issues)?

If all checks pass, proceed to Step 5.

#### Invoke the Reviewer

Invoke `review-worker` with plan role via the Agent tool. `analyze-issue` will fetch the Issue body itself via `shirokuma-flow issue context {number}`.

```text
Agent(
  description: "review-worker plan #{number}",
  subagent_type: "review-worker",
  prompt: "plan #{number}"
)
```

The review result is posted as an Issue comment by `analyze-issue`, and structured output is returned.

#### Processing Review Output

| Output Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| PASS | Follow "On PASS" below |
| NEEDS_REVISION | Follow "On Failure" below to fix and re-review |

#### Review Result Determination

Determine the result from the `**Review result:**` string in review-worker's output. Scan the Agent tool output body for `**Review result:** PASS` or `**Review result:** NEEDS_REVISION`.

| Result String | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| `**Review result:** PASS` | Follow "On PASS" below |
| `**Review result:** NEEDS_REVISION` | Follow "On Failure" below |

> **Immediate Progression (Required)**: On PASS, **do NOT stop here** — proceed immediately to "On PASS" below → Step 5 → Step 6. Update the TodoList "plan review" task to `completed` before moving on. Ending with text-only output is a chain break error.

#### On PASS

> **Chain Autonomous Progression**: Once you reach this section, execute all actions (post comment → Step 5 → Step 6) **within the same response** without stopping. Do not pause for user input.

1. Post a **plan review response comment** (evidence that the review passed):

```bash
shirokuma-flow issue comment {number} /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{number}-review-pass.md
```

Where `/tmp/shirokuma-flow/{number}-review-pass.md` contains the plan review response (PASS result, fixes summary if any).

If PASS was reached after NEEDS_REVISION cycles, include revision details in the file:

```bash
shirokuma-flow issue comment {number} /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{number}-review-pass.md
```

→ Proceed to Step 4a (if epic plan) or Step 5.

### Step 4a: Auto-create Sub-issues (Epic Plans Only)

After review PASS, execute this step if the plan issue body contains a `### Sub-Issue Structure` section **and** no non-plan child issues exist (count of child issues with titles NOT starting with "Plan:" === 0). Skip and proceed to Step 5 if the condition is not met.

The plan issue number is found by scanning `subIssuesSummary` for a child issue with a title starting with "Plan:". Fetch its body via `issue context {plan-issue-number}` to check for the `### Sub-Issue Structure` section.

#### Execution Owner: Re-delegate to plan-issue Skill

Sub-issue **creation** and **placeholder replacement** are performed by **Step 4c** of the `plan-issue` skill. `prepare-flow` re-delegates to `plan-issue` as the orchestrator:

```text
Agent(
  description: "plan-worker sub-issues #{parent-number}",
  subagent_type: "plan-worker",
  prompt: "Create sub-issues for the plan issue #{PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER} of #{parent-number} and replace placeholders. (Run Step 4c only)"
)
```

#### Sub-issue Creation Procedure (plan-issue Step 4c details)

`plan-issue` Step 4c executes the following:

1. Parse the `### Sub-Issue Structure` table and create each sub-issue:
   ```bash
   # Create the body file for each sub-issue
   cat > /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{parent-number}-sub-{n}.md <<'EOF'
   ---
   title: "{sub-issue title}"
   status: "In progress"
   ---

   See #{parent-number} for full plan.
   EOF

   # Create the sub-issue
   shirokuma-flow issue add /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{parent-number}-sub-{n}.md

   # Set parent-child relationship
   shirokuma-flow issue parent {sub-number} {parent-number}
   ```

2. After all sub-issues are created, replace placeholders (`#{sub1}` / `{sub1}`, etc.) in the plan issue body with actual issue numbers, then sync via `issue update` + `issue push`:
   ```bash
   # Fetch plan issue body and replace placeholders
   shirokuma-flow issue context {PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER}
   # Read .shirokuma/github/{org}/{repo}/issues/{PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER}/body.md
   # → cp the body and replace placeholders via python3
   shirokuma-flow issue update {PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER} /tmp/shirokuma-flow/{PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER}-updated-body.md
   shirokuma-flow issue push {PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER}
   ```

> **Full bash example**: See the "Step 4c" section in `plan-issue`.

#### On Failure

When NEEDS_REVISION is returned:

1. Classify issues from subagent output `### Detail` into **[Plan]** and **[Issue description]**
2. **[Issue description]** issues → Fix the relevant sections in the issue body (overview, background, tasks, etc.)
3. **[Plan]** issues → Re-delegate to `plan-issue` with revision instructions, or fix the plan section directly and update the `## Plan` section in the Issue body
4. After fixes, re-run the review via Agent tool (same `review-worker` plan role)
5. **Max retries: 2** (initial review + up to 2 fix-and-review cycles)
6. On 3rd NEEDS_REVISION → Stop the loop, report to user for their judgment

```
plan-issue → Plan written to body
  → Agent(review-worker plan)
    → NEEDS_REVISION → Fix + Update body → Re-review
                         ↓ (failed twice)
                    Report to user
    → PASS → Response comment
```

### Step 5: Update Status (Plan Issue child → Review)

**Plan-issue-centric model (ADR-v3-022, D-1)**: `prepare-flow` manages only the lifecycle of the **plan issue (child)**. Do not directly transition the parent issue (task issue). The parent issue's status is auto-derived by `syncParentStatus` from the plan issue's status.

```bash
shirokuma-flow submit {plan-issue-number}
```

> `submit` transitions the plan issue (child) from `Backlog → Review`, expressing "plan review ready (awaiting human review)". To post a comment together, pass `--comment <file>` (comment is posted before the transition).

> **ADR-v3-022 D-1**: Do NOT transition the parent (task) issue to `Review`. The parent issue's `Review` status is reserved exclusively for PR review. Plan review completion is expressed via the plan issue (child) `Backlog → Review`. After `approve` on the plan issue (child) (`Review → Done`), `syncParentStatus` automatically syncs the parent issue from `Backlog → ToDo`.

### Step 6: Return to User

Display a plan summary and request approval. The plan is a contract with the user — proceeding without approval risks wasted work on a misaligned approach.

Show a summary matching the plan depth level. Follow the `completion-report-style` rule for formatting.

**Required fields** (all levels):
- **Status:** Review
- **Level:** plan depth (Lightweight / Standard / Detailed / Epic)
- **Approach:** one-line summary

**Additional fields** (Standard/Detailed/Epic):
- **Target files** and **Tasks** count (Standard/Detailed)
- **Sub-issues** count and **Integration branch** (Epic)
- **Plan issue:** Number of the created plan issue (all levels)
- **Created sub-issues:** List of created sub-issue numbers (Epic, when Step 4a executed)

**Next steps guidance** (vary by condition):

| Condition | Next steps |
|-----------|-----------|
| Normal (Lightweight / Standard / Detailed) | `/implement-flow #{plan number}` |
| Epic (non-plan sub-issues already created) | Guide each sub-issue number with `/implement-flow #{sub-number}` (creates integration branch, proposes order) |
| Epic (no non-plan sub-issues yet) | Guide each sub-issue number with `/implement-flow #{sub-number}` (creates sub-issues, integration branch, proposes order) |

> **Unified rule**: Always create a plan Issue regardless of plan level, and present `#{plan number}`. The Lightweight-without-plan-issue path is removed. Design guidance (`/design-flow`) is `create-item-flow`'s responsibility and must not appear in `prepare-flow` next steps.

Always ask the user to review the plan and provide feedback if changes are needed.

#### Evolution Signal Auto-Recording

At the end of the plan completion report, auto-record Evolution signals following the "Auto-Recording Procedure at Skill Completion" in the `rule-evolution` rule.

## Arguments

| Format | Example | Behavior |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Issue number | `#42` | Fetch issue and start planning orchestration |
| No argument | — | Ask for issue number via AskUserQuestion |

## Edge Cases

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Child issue with title starting with "Plan:" already exists | Ask whether to overwrite (AskUserQuestion) before delegating |
| Issue is Done | Show warning |
| Issue body is empty | Proceed (planning worker will create the plan issue) |
| Status is already In Progress | Continue, skip status update |
| Status is already Review | Update plan issue, keep status |
| Epic issue (has non-plan sub-issues) | Planning worker uses epic plan template |

## Rule References

| Reference | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| `project-items` rule | In Progress/Review status workflow |
| `output-language` rule | Output language for issue comments and body |
| `github-writing-style` rule | Bullet-point vs prose guidelines |
| `implement-flow` skill | Worker completion unified pattern, UCP check |

## Tool Usage

| Tool | When |
|------|------|
| Bash | `shirokuma-flow issue context/transition/update/add comment` |
| Agent (research-worker) | Step 2a: Conduct research (conditional, subagent, context isolation) |
| Agent (plan-worker) | Step 3: Delegate plan creation (sub-agent, context isolation) |
| Agent (review-worker) | Step 4: Plan review (subagent, context isolation) |
| AskUserQuestion | Overwrite confirmation, issue number prompt |
| TaskCreate, TaskUpdate | Planning orchestration step progress tracking |

## Notes

- This skill is the **orchestrator** — actual plan creation is delegated to `plan-worker` (`plan-issue` skill) via Agent tool
- **Does not implement** — planning only. Implementation is `implement-flow`'s responsibility
- Plans are persisted as plan issues (child issues) — available across sessions
- `Review` is the user approval gate — self-approving would bypass the human quality check that catches misaligned assumptions early
- **Chain autonomous progression**: After the review skill (Step 4) completes, stopping forces the user to manually prompt continuation. Immediately proceed to Steps 5-6 based on the `**Review result:**` string. Check TaskList for remaining pending steps after each skill result
