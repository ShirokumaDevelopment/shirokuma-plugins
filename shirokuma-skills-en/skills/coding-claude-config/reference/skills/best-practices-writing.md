# Writing Effective Instructions

Guidelines for writing clear, actionable skill instructions.

For core principles and organization, see [best-practices.md](best-practices.md).
For testing and evaluation, see [best-practices-testing.md](best-practices-testing.md).

## Checklists for Complex Tasks

### Provide copyable progress trackers

```markdown
## Task Progress

Copy and update:
- [ ] Step 1: Analyze input files
- [ ] Step 2: Extract data
- [ ] Step 3: Transform format
- [ ] Step 4: Validate output
- [ ] Step 5: Generate report

Status: [  ] / 5 complete
```

### Why

Helps Claude track multi-step workflows and maintain state

## Validation Loops

### Structure as iterative improvement

```markdown
## Workflow

1. Generate initial output
2. Run validator
3. If errors found:
   a. Analyze error messages
   b. Fix identified issues
   c. Return to step 2
4. If validation passes: Complete
```

### With explicit limits

```markdown
## Workflow with Safety

Repeat up to 3 times:
1. Generate output
2. Validate
3. Fix errors

If still failing after 3 attempts:
- Report specific errors
- Suggest manual intervention
```

## Template Pattern

### Strict requirements (low freedom)

```markdown
## Output Format (EXACT)

\```json
{
  "status": "success" | "error",
  "data": {
    "field1": "value1",
    "field2": "value2"
  },
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 format"
}
\```

Do NOT deviate from this structure.
```

### Flexible requirements (high freedom)

```markdown
## Suggested Output Format

Consider using:
\```json
{
  "status": "...",
  "data": {...},
  "metadata": {...}
}
\```

Adapt as needed for your use case.
```

## Examples Pattern

### Input/output pairs demonstrate desired behavior

```markdown
## Example 1: Simple Case

##### Input

\```csv
name,age,city
John,30,NYC
\```

##### Output

\```json
[{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "NYC"}]
\```

## Example 2: Edge Case

##### Input

\```csv
name,age,city
John,"30,5",NYC
\```

##### Output

\```json
[{"name": "John", "age": "30,5", "city": "NYC"}]
\```

Note: Age preserved as string due to comma.
```

## Conditional Workflow Pattern

### Guide through decision points

```markdown
## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Operation Type

Creating new content?
→ Follow "Creation Workflow" below

Editing existing content?
→ Follow "Editing Workflow" below

Migrating or converting?
→ Follow "Migration Workflow" below

### Creation Workflow
1. Generate structure
2. Populate content
3. Validate output

### Editing Workflow
1. Load existing content
2. Apply modifications
3. Preserve metadata

### Migration Workflow
1. Parse source format
2. Transform data
3. Validate conversion
```

## Code and Scripts

### Solve, Don't Punt

Handle errors explicitly, don't assume Claude will handle them.

**Bad (punting to Claude)**:
```python
result = requests.get(url)
data = result.json()
```

**Good (explicit error handling)**:
```python
try:
    result = requests.get(url, timeout=30)
    result.raise_for_status()
    data = result.json()
except requests.Timeout:
    print("ERROR: Request timed out after 30 seconds")
    sys.exit(1)
except requests.HTTPError as e:
    print(f"ERROR: HTTP {e.response.status_code}")
    sys.exit(1)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    print("ERROR: Invalid JSON response")
    sys.exit(1)
```

### Justify Constants

Explain magic numbers with comments.

**Unexplained**:
```python
timeout=30
```

**Justified**:
```python
timeout=30  # HTTP requests typically complete within 30 seconds
MAX_RETRIES=3  # Balance between reliability and performance
CHUNK_SIZE=8192  # Optimal buffer size for file I/O
```

### Utility Scripts

Pre-made scripts are more reliable than generated code.

**Benefits**:
- Consistent behavior
- Pre-tested
- Token efficient
- No generation errors

**Example structure**:
- `skill-name/SKILL.md`
- `skill-name/scripts/validate.py`
- `skill-name/scripts/transform.sh`
- `skill-name/scripts/helpers/parser.py`
- `skill-name/scripts/helpers/formatter.py`

**Usage in SKILL.md**:
```markdown
## Validation

Run the validation script:
\```bash
python scripts/validate.py input.json --strict
\```

See script help for options:
\```bash
python scripts/validate.py --help
\```
```

### Visual Analysis

Convert PDFs to images for layout understanding.

```python
# For PDF layout analysis
import pdf2image

# Convert first page to image
images = pdf2image.convert_from_path(
    'document.pdf',
    first_page=1,
    last_page=1
)

# Claude can analyze image layout
# Better than text-only for complex layouts
```

**Why**: Text extraction loses spatial relationships; images preserve layout.

### Verifiable Intermediate Outputs

Plan-validate-execute pattern for batch operations:

```markdown
## Batch Processing Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Plan
Create operation plan:
\```json
{
  "operations": [
    {"file": "doc1.md", "action": "transform", "params": {...}},
    {"file": "doc2.md", "action": "transform", "params": {...}}
  ]
}
\```

### Step 2: Validate Plan
Review plan with user before execution.

### Step 3: Execute
Process each operation.

### Step 4: Report Results
Summary of successes and failures.
```

**Benefits**:
- User can review before execution
- Errors caught early
- Auditability

### File Path Requirements

Always use forward slashes for cross-platform compatibility.

**Cross-platform**:
```python
script_path = "scripts/helper.py"
config_path = "config/settings.json"
```

**Windows-only** (breaks on Unix):
```python
script_path = "scripts\\helper.py"  # Bad
config_path = "config\\settings.json"  # Bad
```

**Use pathlib for robustness**:
```python
from pathlib import Path

script_path = Path("scripts") / "helper.py"
config_path = Path("config") / "settings.json"
```

## No Implicit References (Session-Independent Writing)

Content that skills write to GitHub (Issue comments, PR bodies, Discussions) must be written assuming **the next session's AI has no access to the conversation history**.

### Why This Matters

When a session transfers, the next AI can only access what was written to GitHub. Work summaries posted as Issue comments serve as the primary context for future conversations, so the quality of GitHub writes directly affects session continuity.

### Patterns to Avoid (Implicit References)

| NG Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| "as discussed earlier" | Implicit reference to conversation | Write the discussed content explicitly |
| "as mentioned above" | Reference to earlier text in same comment | Repeat the specific content |
| "as we agreed" | Implicit reference to in-session agreement | State the agreement explicitly |
| "as mentioned earlier" | Reference to a prior comment | Quote the comment ID or content |
| "as decided in the previous session" | Cross-session implicit reference | Describe the decision concretely |

### Recommended Pattern

```markdown
# NG: Implicit reference
As discussed, we'll go with Approach A.

# OK: Self-contained
We adopt Approach A (add a new parseXml function in `src/utils/parser.ts`).
Reason: Approach B risks conflicting with the existing JSON parser.
```

```markdown
# NG: Implicit reference
as discussed, this fixes the issue.

# OK: Self-contained
This commit fixes the null pointer exception in `getUser()` (Issue #342).
Root cause: The `id` field was not validated before the database lookup.
```

### Impact on Skill Design

When designing GitHub write templates:
- Avoid phrases like "see previous discussion" or "as above" in templates
- Use variable placeholders (`{concrete content}`) to enforce self-contained descriptions
- Leverage Issue numbers (`#{number}`) and values obtained via git/CLI commands (commit hashes, etc.)

See also `best-practices.md` for the "GitHub Output Quality" section.
